## Bioinformatics & Data Analysis

I work with microbial ecology, multi-omics data analysis, and reproducible workflows in R and Python.  
My experience includes 16S metagenomics, functional prediction, targeted transcriptomics, and LC–MS/MS-based lipid data processing.

### Main Interests
- Microbiome analysis (skin, scalp, and environmental samples)
- Multi-omics integration (taxonomic, functional, transcript, lipid data)
- Reproducible pipelines (R, Snakemake, Bash)
- Data visualization and statistical analysis

### Technical Skills
**Tools:** DADA2, QIIME2, phyloseq, DESeq2, MZmine, Snakemake, FastQC, GROMACS  
**Databases:** SILVA, Greengenes, RefSeq  
**Methods:** Diversity analysis, differential abundance, QC workflows, functional prediction
**Languages:** R, Python, Bash

### Selected Public Projects
- **Assembly and long-read analysis:** Pipeline for long-read assembly and functional profiling using public datasets.

- **Bioinformatics Study Notebooks:** Exploratory analyses and templates for microbial and multi-omics workflows.

### Notes
Some industry projects are not public due to IP restrictions.  
Public repositories reflect study materials, workflow templates, and reproducible examples.
